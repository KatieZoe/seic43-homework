<h1>Hello Explorer!</h1>

<h2>🦁 🐯 🐻‍❄️ 🐼 🐵</h2>

<h2>If you're looking at this, I'm guessing you love animals as much as I do</h2>

<h3>Explore the different habitats and animals within them that surround our world </h3>

<p>As a child growing up I loved to get animal encyclopedias telling me about the different animal's weight, height, home and fun facts! I hope you enjoy this as much as I did making it!</p>
